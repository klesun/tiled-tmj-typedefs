Typescript type definitions for the [.tmj](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/json-map-format/#point) JSON tilemap structure exportable from the [Tiled](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled) tilemap editor.

Should be useful for people developing js/ts apps that process output of the Tiled editor: for code completion, type validation, quick documentation view.

Feel free to submit PRs if you spot any inconsistencies. Typedefs were based on the documentation, but some optional fields may have been incorrectly specified as mandatory.
